# Madimadica
Hi, I'm Madi, a full-stack web-developer. I mostly work in the backend with Java/Spring Boot, but I'm also well versed in the frontend. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and another in Applied Mathematics. Even though I work in the CS industry, I still love learning and teaching academic topics in math and CS.

## Language (Skill) Tier List

| Tier  | Languages |
|-------|----------|
| S     | Java |
| A     | JavaScript, Python, PHP, SQL (MySQL, SQL Server), CSS |
| B     | LaTeX, Markdown |
| C     | C++, C#, TypeScript |
| D     | C, R, Go |
| E | Rust |

<!-- **S-Tier** languages are those that I understand insanely well, from syntax to the standard APIs. *Java* is my only S-tier, as no other language I know comes close to the 10k+ hours I've spent learning and using Java.  
**A-tier** languages are those that I know very well, and have used for thousands of hours each, just not to the extreme depth that I understand Java. Everything else I've dabbled in for a few dozen or few hundred hours, but am either so out of practice (C-tier), or only learned the basics (D and E-tier). -->


## Project Portfolio
I have worked on many projects over the years, and below are some of them. The "type" categorizes the project. *Maven* is a public Maven dependency. *LaTeX* is a repo of `.tex` files for math courses, where some parts were done on paper and missing. *Misc* are miscellaneous repos that don't have a major category. *WIP* is a work-in-progress repo that is still under construction/development.
